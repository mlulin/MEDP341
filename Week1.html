		<p>The index page of ORAL.pub is designed with a minimalist aesthetic, 
        featuring an interactive and dynamic layout. 
        It showcases the latest digital poetry and art projects, 
        emphasizing the experimental and innovative nature of the content. 
        The page includes links to various works that integrate multimedia elements like audio, 
        video, and interactive coding, making the art inseparable from its digital form. 
        The site also offers navigation to different categories and past issues, 
        inviting exploration of web-native creativity. <br/>
        What strikes me most about this site is its index page, 
        which is seemingly cluttered, yet highly distinctive and full of mouse interactivity. 
        It reminds me of what I've learned about p5.js.</p>
