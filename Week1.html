		<p>The index page of ORAL.pub is designed with a minimalist aesthetic, 
        featuring an interactive and dynamic layout. 
        It showcases the latest digital poetry and art projects, 
        emphasizing the experimental and innovative nature of the content. 
        The site also offers navigation to different categories and past issues, 
        inviting exploration of web-native creativity. <br/>
        ORAL.pub values spaces that provoke thought and emotion through unexpected, 
        innovative uses of technology, whether through simple HTML/CSS or cutting-edge techniques. 
        I agree with the idea that the platform is dedicated to creative expression rather than technical expertise, 
        and I think it's this idea that makes the platform such a unique and exciting space in the digital realm.</br> 
        What strikes me most about this site is its index page, 
        which is seemingly cluttered, yet highly distinctive and full of mouse interactivity. 
        It reminds me of what I've learned about p5.js.</p>
