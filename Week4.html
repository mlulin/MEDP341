                target="_blank">"flinty_disregard.html"</a> is the web I chose. Here's a
            breakdown of how it works and how it helps build the interactive
            elements of the site:
        <p>
            <br />
        <h2>Canvas Setup</h2>
        <p>The script creates an HTML canvas element (var ccc = g("cc").getContext("2d");) which acts as the drawing
            surface for the text animation. All visual elements are rendered within this canvas.
            The font is set to a custom style (ccc.font = "24px cursive") that defines how the text will appear.</p>
        <h2>Text Animation</h2>
        <p>The variable s contains the string that will be animated. It's broken down into individual characters,
            including letters and digits (which control spacing and row breaks).
            The characters are stored in an array l, where each character is assigned properties such as x, y
            (position), xv (horizontal velocity), yv (vertical velocity), and ya (vertical acceleration).</p>
        <h2>Movement Logic</h2>
        <p>The upd() function is called at intervals to update the position of each character.
            For each character in the array l, its position (x and y) is adjusted based on its velocity (xv, yv) and
            acceleration (ya). Characters fall vertically with acceleration, simulating gravity, until they reach the
            base level (base = 300).
            Once the character reaches its target position (tar), its velocity and acceleration are set to zero, and it
            stops moving.</p>
        <h2>Mouse Interaction</h2>
        <p>The clk() function introduces user interaction. When a user clicks on the canvas, the characters that are
            still moving (determined by l[i].m) are affected.
            The xv and yv velocities are updated to make the characters bounce away from their current positions, and
            they start moving toward new target positions (tar values). This simulates an animation effect where the
            characters react to the user's input, creating dynamic movement on click.</p>
        <!-- Canvas for background -->
        <canvas id="bgCanvas"></canvas>

        <!-- JavaScript for interactive canvas background -->
        <script>
            const canvas = document.getElementById('bgCanvas');
            const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
            canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
            canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

            // Resize canvas if the window is resized
            window.addEventListener('resize', function () {
                canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
                canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
            });

            // Draw circles that respond to mouse movement
            window.addEventListener('mousemove', function (event) {
                const x = event.clientX;
                const y = event.clientY;
                drawCircle(x, y);
            });

            // Draw a simple circle on the canvas
            function drawCircle(x, y) {
                ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // Clear previous drawings
                ctx.beginPath();
                ctx.arc(x, y, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2); // Draw circle at mouse location
                ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.5)';
                ctx.fill();
                ctx.closePath();
            }
